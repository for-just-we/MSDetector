# MSDetector
Code for TASE 2022 paper: MSDetector: A Static Php Webshell Detection System based on Deep-Learning


The developing environment

- PreProcessModule: 
  * jdk 11
  * maven 3.6.2
  * IDEA

- DeepLearningModule:
  * python 3.7
  * pytorch 1.7.1
  * scikit-learn 0.24.1
  * transformers 4.0.1


There is another project which use CodeBert to detect webshell: [CodeBERT-based-webshell-detection](https://github.com/lyccol/CodeBERT-based-webshell-detection)

We provide some testcases in dictionary phpProcessor/src/test/files.

# Datasets

unfortunately our dataset has been used in another project with another institute, our first party require us not to open-source datasets.
